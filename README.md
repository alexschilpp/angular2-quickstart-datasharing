# angular2-quickstart-datasharing

This mini app demonstrates the following two types of data sharing in Angular2:

1. Data sharing between sibling components via a service (*counting.service.ts*)
2. Pass data from child to parent while parent listens for child event (*clicked*)

## Run the app

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and start the local server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
